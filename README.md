# Keith's language hacking space

This is a tracking repo for all the code I will write as part of my journey to understand programming languages. I think of it as a great way to explore not just programming language design (we like programming languages that help us clarify and structure our thoughts), but also how computers fundamentally work (we like compilers that produce performant binaries). Of course, it's also an easy target for a meaty project, if you want to learn a new language.

Each implementation comes with one line about why it is notable in my journey.

## Implementations

- [Java](https://github.com/Keithagy/crafting-interpreters-java) -- This implements a [Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/appendix-i.html) tree-walk interpreter that runs on the JVM. My first language implementation!
- [C](https://github.com/Keithagy/crafting-interpreters-c) -- Lox again, but this time implementing the underlying bytecode VM (a stack-based one) from scratch.

## Planned

- Go
- Rust
- Haskell
- Zig
- Ocaml
- CommonLisp
- Clojure
